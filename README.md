# Factors influencing stock option returns: On the Relevance of Systematic and Idiosyncratic Volatility

 [Description]: 
 The classic hedging strategy for options is delta hedging. Here, the option is hedged against changes in the price of the underlying asset by means of an offsetting position in the underlying asset [1]. In the context of the Black-Scholes model, such a strategy has a discounted expected value of zero, e.g. if the position in the underlying is adjusted daily.

Empirically, it has been shown that such a hedging strategy generates a loss on average when an option is purchased [2]. This can be explained by the restrictive assumption of constant volatility of the underlying asset in the Black-Scholes model.

In reality, volatility fluctuates, so that the seller of an option bears the risk of increasing volatility of the underlying. Thus, the negative returns can be interpreted as a volatility risk premium paid by the buyer to the seller for taking on the volatility risk. For options on single stocks, the volatility of the underlying can be divided into a systematic and an idiosyncratic component by means of a corresponding factor model [3].

In the course of this paper, the empirical analysis of the cross-section of delta-neutral option returns will be used to investigate the extent to which the volatility risk premium is driven by the two components. In addition, a further breakdown of systematic volatility can be made with respect to systematic risk factors.
